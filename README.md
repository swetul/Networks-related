# Networks-related

In this repository are some networking related mini projects

## 1. P2P Chat

- This mini-project involves creating a distributed P2P chat system using UDP datagrams in a Local_Area Network.
- The goal was to create a peer to peer ad-hoc service to send and receive text messages between nodes on a network or by default as a broadcast system.
- Each node in the system can have clients connect to it and clients send and receive broadcast messages which are transmitted to other nodes on the network by the parent node.

## 2. Aloha broadcast system (See simulations repository)

## 3. Multicast Routing (See simulations repository)
